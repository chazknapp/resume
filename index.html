        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology, geography, and creativity. My academic journey has led me to explore 
            geospatial data analysis, computational modeling, and machine learning, while my creative side thrives through music composition and recording. 
            Whether Iâ€™m working on mapping environmental changes or layering tape loops to a new composition, I enjoy finding the balance of computation and artistic freedom
